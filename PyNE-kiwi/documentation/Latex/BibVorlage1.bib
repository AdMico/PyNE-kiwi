abstract = {Ballistic transport of electrons at room temperature in top-gated InAs nanowire (NW) transistors is experimentally observed and theoretically examined. From length dependent studies, the low-field mean free path is directly extracted as ∼150 nm. The mean free path is found to be independent of temperature due to the dominant role of surface roughness scattering. The mean free path was also theoretically assessed by a method that combines Fermi's golden rule and a numerical Schr{\"{o}}dinger-Poisson simulation to determine the surface scattering potential with the theoretical calculations being consistent with experiments. Near ballistic transport (∼80{\%} of the ballistic limit) is demonstrated experimentally for transistors with a channel length of ∼60 nm, owing to the long mean free path of electrons in InAs NWs. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

@article{Knott2011,
abstract = {Phase coherent transport phenomena are studied in a magnetic, two-dimensional hole system confined in a strained InAs quantum-well structure. At low magnetic fields we observe a well pronounced weak antilocalization signature, demonstrating that magnetic ions in proximity to the itinerant holes preserve phase coherent transport, although magnetic effects like the anomalous and planar Hall effects are present at low temperatures. From fits to the conductivity correction, spin and phase relaxation times are extracted in a large temperature range from 200 mK to 16 K. From the dependency of the spin relaxation time on temperature and in-plane magnetic fields, we conclude that the Dyakonov-Perel mechanism is the dominant spin relaxation mechanism. The metamorphic growth of the heterostructure causes a nonplanar quantum well that enables the formation of magnetic barriers in the presence of a parallel applied magnetic field. Transport through these magnetic barriers causes a positive magnetoresistance superimposed on the weak antilocalization signal.},
