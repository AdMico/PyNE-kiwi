## Planned updates for next version

- Deprecate `Instrument.py` if none of its functions are used (i.e., is true legacy).
- Implement 'abort sweep' button in `Gate Sweep.py`.
- Clean up ilocs in `Gate Sweep.py` and implement gate voltage arrays as pandas dataframes.
- Clean up the B1500, B2201 and K2401 instrument programs to simplify the code to essentials.
- Implement 'switched' sweep set with a B1500 SMU each on the source and the drain.
- Add a feature to add short notes to the log file.
- Add a live graph of the current sweep for the GUIs in `Gate Sweep.py` and `Time Sweep.py`.
- Clean up file structure (e.g. empty purgatory).
- APM to create github repo for the hardware and link to it here for context.
