This module reads, supplies and updates the current 'measurement ID', a running number on each setup.
A two letter identifier of each setup, e.g., EL for Electronics Lab, MS for Microscope, is also saved in this file.
Both are read in the sweep function sweepAndSave() each time a measurement is done.
